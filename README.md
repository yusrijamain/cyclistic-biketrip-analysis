# Case Study: Cyclistic Bike Trip Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to provide insights to a fictional company called Cyclistic from datasets that span from May 2022 to April 2023. As a junior data analyst, I was tasked to find out "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?". The goal is to use the insights (metrics: trends, distance, duration etc) gathered from the data to help design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. Excel, Microsoft SQL Server and Tableau were among the tools used in this data analysis process. The findings of this project will be used as recommendations for the company’s marketing team to improve their next marketing campaign.

## About Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company based in Chicago that launched in the year 2016. Since their introduction in the bike-sharing market, the company had grown to a fleet of over 5000 bicycles and a network of over 600 stations that are geotracked and locked across the city of Chicago. With a marketing strategy that resolves around the approach of “building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments”, Cyclistic offers flexible pricing plans to target both casual riders and annual members through single-ride passes and full-day passes for casual riders and annual memberships for Cyclistic members. On top of that, Cyclistic also offers two types of rides which are classic and electric bikes for their customers to choose from.

## About The Data
The City of Chicago owns the historical trip data under the [agreement](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC to provide the data available to the public in order to support bicycling as a means of alternative transportation in the city. For the purpose of this case study, the datasets will be used to answer business questions for a fictional company called Cyclistic as its data elements are appropriate, complete, and accurate in order to gain data-driven insights to solve problems from the business questions.
